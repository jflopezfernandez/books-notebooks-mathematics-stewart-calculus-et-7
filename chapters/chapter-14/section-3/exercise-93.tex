\begin{exercise}
	You are told that there is a function $f$ whose partial derivatives are $f_x\left(x,y\right)=x+4y$ and $f_y\left(x,y\right)=3x-y$. Should you believe it?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	No. By Clairaut's Theorem (Theorem~\ref{theorem-clairauts-theorem}), if $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ are continuous, then $f_{xy}\left(x,y\right)=f_{yx}\left(x,y\right)$. However, clearly that cannot be the case if the partial derivatives we are being given are correct. We must conclude that a function with those partial derivatives does not exist.
\end{solution}
