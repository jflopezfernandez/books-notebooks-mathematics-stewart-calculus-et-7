\begin{exercise}
	Suppose that $\lim\limits_{\left( x, y \right) \to \left( 3, 1 \right)} f\left(x,y\right) = 6$. What can you say about the value of $f\left(3,1\right)$? What if $f$ is continuous?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	Unless we know that $f$ is continuous at $\left( 3, 1 \right)$, we cannot say anything about the value of $f\left(3,1\right)$. If we know $f$ was continuous, then by the definition of continuity $f\left(3,1\right) = \lim\limits_{\left(x,y\right) \to \left(3,1\right)} f\left(x,y\right)$, and thus $f\left(3,1\right) = 6$.
\end{solution}
