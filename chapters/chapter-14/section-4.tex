\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{differential} $dw$ is defined in terms of the differentials $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$ of the independent variables by
	\begin{equation}
	\label{equation-differentials-3d}
	dw = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}dz
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
