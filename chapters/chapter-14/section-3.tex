\begin{theorem}[Clairaut's Theorem]
	\label{theorem-clairauts-theorem}
	Suppose $f$ is defined on a disk $D$ that contains the point $\left( a, b \right)$. If the functions $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ are both continuous on $D$, then
	\begin{equation*}
	f_{xy}\left(x,y\right)=f_{yx}\left(x,y\right).
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
