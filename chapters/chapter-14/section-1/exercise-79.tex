	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that, by taking logarithms, the general Cobb-Douglas function $P = bL^{\alpha}K^{1-\alpha}$ can be expressed as
		\begin{equation*}
		\ln \frac{P}{K} = \ln b + \alpha \ln \frac{L}{K}
		\end{equation*}
		\item If we let $x = \ln \frac{L}{K}$ and $y = \ln \frac{P}{K}$, the equation in part (a) becomes the linear equation $y = \alpha x + \ln b$. Use Table 2 (in Example 3) to make a table of values of $\ln \frac{L}{K}$ and $\ln \frac{P}{K}$ for the years $1899$-$1922$. Then use a graphing calculator or computer to find the least squares regression line through the points $\left( \ln \frac{L}{K}, \ln \frac{P}{K} \right)$.
		\item Deduce that the Cobb-Douglas production function is $P = 1.01L^{0.75}K^{0.25}$.
