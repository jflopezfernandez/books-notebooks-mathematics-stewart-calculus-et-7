	\index{function!Cobb-Douglas}
	A manufacturer has modeled its yearly production function $P$ (the monetary value of its entire production in millions of dollars) as a Cobb-Douglass function
	\begin{equation*}
	P\left( L, K \right) = 1.47L^{0.65}K^{0.35}
	\end{equation*}
	where $L$ is the number of labor hours (in thousands) and $K$ is the invested capital (in millions of dollars). Find $P\left( 120, 20 \right)$ and interpret it.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	\begin{align*}
	P\left( L, K \right) &= 1.47L^{0.65}K^{0.35} \\
	P\left( 120, 20 \right) &= 1.47\left( 120 \right)^{0.65} \left( 20 \right)^{0.35} \\
	P\left( 120, 20 \right) &\approx 94.22
	\end{align*}
	The monetary value of the goods produced by the manufacturer after investing $120$ thousand labor hours and $20$ million dollars of capital is $94.22$ million dollars.
\end{solution}
