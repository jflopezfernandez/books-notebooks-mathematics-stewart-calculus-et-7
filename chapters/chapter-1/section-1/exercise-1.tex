\begin{exercise}
	If $f\left(x\right)=x+\sqrt{2-x}$ and $g\left(u\right)=u+\sqrt{2-u}$, is it true that $f=g$?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	Yes. The $x$ and $u$ variables are free in $f$ and $g$, respectively, and thus both the image and pre-image of $f$ and $g$ are exactly the same.
\end{solution}
