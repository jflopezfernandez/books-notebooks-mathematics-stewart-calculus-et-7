\begin{exercise}
	If $f\left(x\right)=\frac{x^2-x}{x-1}$ and $g\left(x\right)=x$, is it true that $f=g$?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	No. The two functions are not equal to one another because in order to be equal to one another, $f\left(x\right)$ must be equal to $g\left(x\right)$ for all values of $x$. In this particular case, $f$ has a discontinuity at $x-1$, and while the discontinuity is removable, $f$ itself is defined specifically with the discontinuity included, and thus cannot be equal to $g$.
\end{solution}
